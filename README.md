#### _An interactive website that runs code to collect the current hour and minutes on a new Date object when the mouse hovers on the h5 Block Element,
Wednesday, July 26th, 2017_

## Description

_The application collects the current hour and minutes of Portland. We then use Portland time as the base. By seperating the hour from the minutes, we can use military time to essentially add or subtract hours from Portland time to represent the current time of different cities. The ":" and the minutes can then be concatenated in the argument of each if, else if statement depending on which "city" is selected by the mouse hovering over it._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _launch the application in your web browser_
* _move your mouse over each city_
* _see that the current time replaces the city name_
* _when the mouse moves away, see the city name is put back in place._


_You do not need a server for this application_
